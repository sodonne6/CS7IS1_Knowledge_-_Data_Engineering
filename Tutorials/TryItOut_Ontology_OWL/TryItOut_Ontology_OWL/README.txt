Movies.drawio is the Movies ontology in as created in draw.io

Movies.drawio.xml is the XML file exported from draw.io used as input to the CHOWLK converter which creates an Turtle OWL representation of an ontology drawn with draw.io

movies.owl.ttl is based on output generated from the CHOWLK converter of the ontology PLUS instances mentioned in the lecture wrt the Godfather movie added in. This can be used as an input to Protege to explore the inferences that take place as discussed in the Lecture (Make sure to start the Hermit reasoner in Protege to see the inferences made)

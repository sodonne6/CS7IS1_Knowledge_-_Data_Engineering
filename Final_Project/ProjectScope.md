## Global Flight Connectivity

I would like to create a knowledge graph centered around global flight connectivity that models direct routes between destinations as well as how cities link with layovers. I am interested in this as I enjoy travelling and know the annoyance of connection flights. My KG would capture details of airports,cities,airlines and how they can be connected. As well as this I would like to provide detail about average travel time, number of layovers and distance travelled

# Ontology that defines the knowledge graph scheme with
• Minimum 8 classes (maximum 3 subclasses)  
• Minimum 6 object properties (two of which have cardinality restrictions) and include an
example of a transitive, a symmetric and an inverseOf property  
• Minimum of 4 data properties with datatypes and cardinality specified  
• Maximum 3 external interlinks to relevant knowledge in LODcloud  
• Reuse from other ontologies and vocabularies as appropriate  

# At least 30 instance triples
• e.g. Bono lead_singer U2 is an instance triple; whereas Rock genre_of Music is
an ontology/vocabulary type triple  
• With at least a third of instances being uplifted using RML mapping(s) from
CSV(s) with relevant data. (The schema of CSV should not just be a one to one
mapping from columns of data to the graph – e.g. not all columns uplifted,
column titles different from terms used in ontology etc.)  
• Some Example SHACL shapes (see later in module) for instance validation  

# Create seven different (not just variations of the same query) SPARQL queries on your knowledge graph
• in doing so demonstrate use of a wide variety of SPARQL clauses (e.g. filters,
aggregations etc.)
